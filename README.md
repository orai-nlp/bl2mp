# How Well Can BERT Learn the Grammar of an Agglutinative and Flexible-Order Language? The Case of Basque.

Data (pretraining corpora and BL2MP dataset), models and evaluation scripts from our work [*How Well Can BERT Learn the Grammar of an Agglutinative and Flexible-Order Language? The Case of Basque.*]() accepted at LREC-COLING2024.


## BL2MP (Basque L2 student-based Minimal Pairs):

The BL2MP test set, designed to assess the grammatical knowledge of language Models in the Basque language, inspired by the BLiMP benchmark. The BL2MP dataset includes examples sourced from the bai&by language academy, derived from essays written by students enrolled at the academy. These instances provide a wealth of authentic and natural grammatical errors, representing genuine mistakes made by learners and thus offering a realistic reflection of real-world language errors.

*BL2MP* is available on [HuggingFace ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/datasets/orai-nlp/bl2mp) too.

## Pretraining corpora:

We employed three corpora of different sizes (5M, 25M, 125M) in our experiments, and we share it in its raw and lemmatized versions:

## Models

## Evaluation Script usage:

We used the tool [minicons](https://github.com/kanishkamisra/minicons) to evaluate (0-shot) our MLMs on BL2MP, which uses Salazar et al. (2020) to score sentences.

It can be installed with pip:

```
pip install minicons
```

And the we evaluate a MLMs as follows:

```
python3 mlm-score.py  --input bl2mpjsonl --output_dir output/ --lm orai-nlp/ElhBERTeu-medium --device cuda:0
```

There are different versions of the dataset and evaluation script, created for different experiments, but all of them use the same approach and call to minicons, and differ only in reading the input data, and the conditions set to filter minimal-pairs to compute the accuracy.
